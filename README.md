# credit-risk-classification

## Project Overview
This is the Credit Risk Classification Project.  In this project, we will use our knowledge of Python and supervised learning to train and evaluate models based on loan risk.

## Project Goals

We will pull the data from the loan data CSV by reading it into a dataframe with Pandas.  From there, we will split, fit and predict using train test split, logistic regression and other accuracy and matrix formulas.  We do this with both the actual data and then the re-sampled ata.
